      "- The last decade and the last 50 years were the warmest in the past 1,000 years, according to the analysis of the ice cores.\n",
      "- At least eight major droughts caused by a failure of the South Asian Monsoon were identified in the ice cores, including a catastrophic seven-year-long dry spell resulting in over 600,000 deaths.\n",
      "- The research, supported by the National Science Foundation, suggests that human activity has contributed to the observed warming in the late 20th century.\n",
      "- The ice core record shows instances of monsoon failures and droughts, with the most devastating one occurring in 1790. The cause of these failures remains unknown.\n",
      "- Data from the last century indicates that human activities have contributed to climate change in the region, leading to increased drying and desertification.\n",
      "- The disappearance of 75 percent of the ice on Kilimanjaro since 1912 is attributed, in part, to global warming, providing further evidence for human-driven warming.\n",

      "This paper proposes a new performance metric called Relevance Score (RS) for evaluating supervised learning algorithms in machine learning. The authors argue that the commonly used Classification Accuracy (CA) metric is not suitable for certain applications where there is randomness in the output and multiple acceptable outcomes. The Relevance Score is based on probabilistic distances between predicted and actual outcomes and aims to measure how relevant the predicted outcome is for a given observed context. The authors evaluate the proposed metric on a dataset from an intelligent lighting pilot installation and compare it to the CA metric, finding that the Relevance Score is more appropriate for this type of application. The authors also investigate the influence of different parameters on the Relevance Score and test it on a dataset with randomly generated output. Overall, the results suggest that the Relevance Score is a better metric for evaluating machine learning algorithms in applications where the relevance of predictions is critical.

      "Summary: In common usage, climate change describes global warmingâthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureâand its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\n",
      "Climate change is causing a range of increasing impacts on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 Â°C (2.2 Â°F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 Â°C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 Â°C (4.9 Â°F) by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 Â°C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.\n",

      "Summary: The global warming controversy concerns the public debate over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action can or should be taken to curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a very strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-com\u001b[0m\n",

      "Final Answer: Global warming refers to the ongoing increase in global average temperature caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels. It is leading to climate change, which includes impacts such as expanding deserts, heat waves, wildfires, melting permafrost, glacial retreat, sea ice loss, intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. It is considered the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Efforts to reduce emissions and limit warming are necessary to mitigate these impacts.\u001b[0m\n",
